# python-challenge
The purpose of this code is to gain experience using python to analyze large data sets. 
The first script PyBank analyzes financial records by calculating total months in dataset, net profit/loss over entire period, average change in profit/loss over time, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits. The results should output to the terminal and export a text file with the results. 
The second script PyPoll analyzes a large set of poll data and calculates total number of votes, a list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
